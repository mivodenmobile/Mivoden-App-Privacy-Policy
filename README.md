# Camp Mivoden Mobile App Privacy Policy
Last updated: August 3, 2022

## Data We Collect
The only data we collect about a user is their email address. We will also create and keep random, unique identification keys for each user.

## Data We Use
The emails we collect are used to authenticate users' accounts and reset their passwords. We will only email promotional and feature-update emails to users who have explicitely requested them. We will email all users if there are updates to this privacy policy. 

We use the unique user IDs we create to allow users read access to only the user information they create.

## How We Store the Data We Collect
We use Google Firebase to store and secure the data we collect. You can read Firebase's privacy policy [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy). We use Firebase's security rules language to control access to our information and user data we collect. We clearly define that a user with a certain ID can only read and write data to a location labeled with that certain ID.

## Updating or Deleting User Data
Any user can change the email address associated with their account on the profile tab of the app. There is also an option for them to delete their account, which will delete all information we store about that user.

## Analytics Information
We use Google Analytics through Firebase to keep track of user events in the app. These events include clicking on videos, tabs, and other things in the app. None of these actions are linked to the users who perform them. Google also keeps track of users' countries of origin and device models used, but this information is also anonymized and not linked to any other user information. You can read more about how Google uses this information [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

## Other User Data Used By the App
The app also uses a user's location to only show the mivoden map when the user is on campus. This location information is used only by the app and is not sent off to any other servers to be stored.

## Notification of Privacy Policy Updates
We will notify all our users of any changes to our privacy policy via the email address provided with their app accounts.

## Protect Your Data
Always be sure to protect your login information. If another party acquires your email and password, they can log in and change your password, requiring you to reset your password using your email to get back in to the app.
